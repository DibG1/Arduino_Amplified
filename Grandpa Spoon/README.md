# Grandpa Spoon

## About the Project

Hand tremors become very common over a period of time as our age increases. People suffering from Parkinson's Disease suffer from this issue. Keeping the goal of finding a solution to aid them, we were able to come up with Grandpa Spoon, a simple and affordable device.

## Working Principle

Grandpa Spoon uses a gyro sensor to detect the angle caused due to the hand tremors and corrects the spoon to stay level using a servo motor. The correction is determined using our code which is based on the input of the gyro sensor. For these, processes are done by an Arduino Uno microcontroller.
